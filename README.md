# Welcome to Brain Candy!

This is Seattle.rb's weekly programming quiz repository. Our rules are simple.
We post one question a week. Solve them in any language you want, but of course
we're biased and love to see ruby.

1. We'll post new questions once a week by Wednesday
2. Fork this repo and work on results on your own fork
3. Discuss and debate on the Seattle.rb study group
4. Merge in new questions each week

Each of these problems should ideally take an hour or so for a beginner-intermediate
ruby developer. Focus on getting something working simply first, then make it
fast, or add more features. Feel free to discuss and share your answers with others
as well.
